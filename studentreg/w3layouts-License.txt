				  <p>Sam &lsquo;O&rsquo;  Nursery and Primary School was initially named God&rsquo;s Wisdom Nursery and Primary  School. The school Proprietor Mr. Samuel Ogunfowora started coaching some  children as preparation for school age. Gradually the number of the population  of the children was increasing and their parents were interested in the way the  children were responding and making progress. This encouraged the proprietor  and he started planning for a better organised way of teaching the children.</p>
				  <p>This  eventually led to the founding of the school by the founding of the school by  the help of the almighty God on 18th day of September, 1995.<br>
			      The school  started with eighteen pupils in attendance. To the glory of God the attendance  was double towards the end of that first term and the members of staff which  started the school were as follow:</p>
                  <p>The first P.T.A meeting was held on  held on 5th of October 1995 and great was the response of the  parents. They praised the school for the efforts made in helping their children  to develop mentally, physically and academically.</p>
                  <p>During the second term, there was a  tremendous increase in the population that led to the employment of the  following teachers more:</p>
                  <p><br>
                    Name                                      Designation                             Date of Appointment<br>
                    1.   Miss Iyabo Obele               Teaching  Staff                         17-04-1996<br>
                    2.   Mr T. Sonoiki                      Teaching  Staff                         11-06-1996<br>
                    3.   Mrs. M. Uzoka                   Teaching  Staff                         16-01-1996</p>
                  <p>As at the third term, the place that  is being used could not accommodate the pupils. Abigger place was sought for at  No 47 Buhari street, Ogudu, Lagos State. Even at this location there was speedy  progress among pupils and the population was also increasing. Another teacher  was also employed during the term by name Mr. Samuel ex. Due to the progress  the proprietor was on the look out for more conducive environment that will aid  the learning of the pupils. To the glory of God, a better accommodation was  discovered for the school at No 1 Gafam Balogun steen, Ogudu. The school moved  to this new site on September 23rd, 1996.

                  <p>The school resumed for the second  term 1996/1997 school year today with the first head-teacher of the school mrs  E. O. Ojofeitimi and the other seven(7) teachers and one(1) non-teaching staff.</p>
